          <div class="content has-text-justified">
            <p>
              CUBE is a lightweight and scalable multi agent block pushing environment for studying cooperation in embodied settings. 
              Agents share a grid world, pushing weighted blocks toward a goal region while dealing with congestion, collisions, 
              force requirements, and changing geometry.
            </p>

            <p>
              The environment follows the PettingZoo parallel API and is parameterized by a single integer <code>n</code>, 
              which sets grid side length, number of agents, and the distribution of block weights. 
              This creates a transparent curriculum from small to large teams. 
              Details about embodied constraints, symbolic actions, and the dual layer interface appear in later sections.

  <!-- Why CUBE -->
  <section class="section hero">
    <div class="container is-max-desktop">
      <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Why CUBE</h2>

      <div class="content has-text-justified">
        <p>
          Traditional reinforcement learning benchmarks emphasize low level action spaces and scalar rewards. 
          These signals are useful for training but offer limited support for symbolic reasoning, interpretability, 
          or debugging. For LLM agents, emitting long sequences of primitive moves and waiting for a numerical reward 
          is slow and unnatural.
        </p>

        <p>
          Symbolic planning domains provide clean abstractions and logical structure but often assume deterministic 
          transitions and ignore embodied dynamics such as collisions, congestion, and force accumulation. 
          They are therefore not sufficient on their own to evaluate embodied LLM agents.
        </p>

        <p>
          CUBE sits between these two extremes. It wraps primitive block pushing into a symbolic vocabulary while 
          grounding every symbolic action in an embodied grid world. This makes it a single testbed where 
          LLM planners, RL agents, and hybrid systems can be compared under the same cooperative conditions.
        </p>
      </div>

  <!-- Why Embodied Tasks -->
  <section class="section hero is-light">
    <div class="container is-max-desktop">
      <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Why Embodied Tasks</h2>

      <div class="content has-text-justified">
        <p>
          Embodied settings introduce structured dependencies. Moving one block can make another reachable, 
          block off corridors, or create new chains that require multiple agents. 
          A strategy that looks good at the symbolic level can fail once the physical layout and timing are taken into account.
        </p>

        <p>
          This combination of spatial and temporal constraints creates rich cooperation challenges that purely symbolic or 
          abstract domains do not capture. CUBE is therefore a natural platform for studying multi agent cooperation, 
          communication, task allocation, and emergent group behavior for LLM based and learned agents alike.

                <strong>Discrete occupancy.</strong>
                Agents and blocks occupy grid cells with at most one entity per cell.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Forces and weights.</strong>
                Each agent exerts one unit of force in its movement direction. 
                Each block has integer weight equal to the force needed to move it and occupies a square whose side length equals that weight.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Block chains.</strong>
                When blocks sit in front of one another in a push direction they form a chain. 
                A chain moves as a composite object when total applied force at the leading face meets or exceeds the sum of weights of all blocks 
                and all destination cells are free.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Agent chains.</strong>
                When agents line up behind a block and push in the same direction, the effective force equals the number of aligned agents. 
                If this meets the chain weight, the block chain and agents advance together; otherwise nothing moves.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Collisions and races.</strong>
                Moves that target occupied cells fail. 
                When several agents aim at the same free cell, a single agent succeeds and others remain in place, 
                creating cell access races that affect how plans unfold.

<!-- Dual-Layer Design -->
<section class="section hero is-light">
  <div class="container is-max-desktop">
    <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Dual Layer Environment for LLM Agents</h2>

    <div class="content has-text-justified">
      <p>
        Human reasoning blends symbolic planning with embodied feedback. 
        We imagine abstract plans, act, compare outcomes with expectations, and adjust. 
        CUBE lets LLM agents follow the same loop: use symbolic structure to reason about goals and relations, 
        then update plans based on the concrete consequences of their actions as the environment evolves.
      </p>

      <p>
        The environment exposes two aligned views of the same world:
        a primitive layer that handles low level grid dynamics, and a symbolic layer that provides compact, 
        expressive actions and concepts for planning.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Action.</strong>
        At the primitive layer, each agent chooses from <code>{STAY, UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT}</code>. 
        These actions determine motion, contact, and force on blocks. 
        At the symbolic layer, agents issue macro actions such as 
        <code>move</code>, <code>move_to_block</code>, <code>rendezvous</code>, <code>push_block</code>, 
        <code>yield_block</code>, <code>idle</code>, and <code>wait_agents</code>. 
        Each symbolic action unfolds into a sequence of primitive moves during runtime.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Observation.</strong>
        The primitive view is a multi channel grid with agent locations, block weights, block ids, and the goal zone. 
        The symbolic view is a structured dictionary that stores grid size, agent positions, block properties 
        such as size, location, and distance to the goal, together with a history of symbolic actions and their status.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Feedback.</strong>
        CUBE provides a scalar reward with step cost and shared delivery reward, 
        plus a library of symbolic concepts for shaping richer feedback. 
        Examples include distance between entities, whether an agent is aligned with a block face, 
        how many agents are aligned, block progress toward the goal, quorum status, and whether a block is currently blocked.

        <strong>Plan.</strong>
        Symbolic actions are compact but highly expressive. 
        Their arguments select blocks, faces, directions, and time horizons, which creates a rich planning space for LLM agents. 
        Plans become short programs written in this vocabulary, while the primitive layer ensures that every step 
        is grounded in an uncertain, continuously changing environment.

        Embodied movement introduces uncertainty during execution. 
        A plan that is feasible at one step can become infeasible a few steps later as blocks move, 
        faces disappear, agents occlude each other, or key cells are taken by another agent. 
        These effects do not appear in purely symbolic domains and are a central reason why cooperation in CUBE remains challenging.

                The heuristic baseline follows a greedy strategy.
                At each stage it selects the block closest to the goal zone and assigns agents to move it,

              <p>
                As language based baselines, the paper evaluates LLM agents in a zero shot style setting.
                Each agent repeatedly receives a symbolic observation and generates short plans written in the
                CUBE action vocabulary, with a prompt that encodes a simple rule
                to always target the block closest to the goal zone.

              <p>
                These naive LLM agents can generate executable plans but perform inconsistently,
                particularly when they must rely on other agents. 
                Smaller models show high variance and longer runtimes, suggesting frequent replanning and difficulty with coordination as <em>n</em> grows.

          <p>
            Overall, the heuristic baseline consistently completes all blocks at the tested scales,
            whereas naive LLM agents reveal a cooperation gap. 
            They can express nontrivial symbolic behavior yet fall short of robust cooperative performance as team size grows. 
            This motivates richer designs for embodied LLM agents that combine symbolic world models, communication, and learning.

            <p>
              As agents move blocks they create new chains, tighten corridors, or close off some paths,
              which can make later deliveries easier or harder. 
              Agents must reason about how current choices change future task difficulty and may need to revise decompositions on the fly.

          <h3 class="title is-4">Spatial reasoning</h3>
          <div class="content has-text-justified">
            <p>
              Successful teams need to understand how blocks interact, which sides can be used for approach,
              and how block chains create soft dependencies between tasks. 
              Simple distance based rules are often not enough when heavy blocks and narrow passages interact.

          <h3 class="title is-4">Synchronization</h3>
          <div class="content has-text-justified">
            <p>
              Many pushes require several agents to reach specific faces of a block at similar times.
              Rendezvous and waiting behavior must be coordinated with path planning and congestion,
              and agents need to recover when timing assumptions fail.

          <div class="content has-text-justified">
            <p>
              Agents rarely know exactly what teammates will do.
              They must form expectations about others, infer goals from movement, and decide when to wait,
              yield, or reroute. Misjudgments can temporarily lock tasks, such as when a single agent
              stands in the only useful staging cell near a block.

          <h3 class="title is-4">Asynchronization</h3>
          <div class="content has-text-justified">
            <p>
              Agents may execute plans with different horizons and therefore fall out of sync.
              Centralized planners, decentralized policies, and communication protocols all have to cope with
              this asynchrony and design strategies that are robust to partial or delayed execution.

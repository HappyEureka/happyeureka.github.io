# Hanqing Yang

I am a Ph.D. student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu), where I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Carlee Joe-Wong](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/cjoewong/) in the [LIONS research group](https://research.ece.cmu.edu/lions/). My research focuses on the design of intelligent and cooperative multi-agent systems capable of making autonomous decisions at scale. Before coming to CMU, I had the valuable opportunity to assist with research projects in AI for healthcare in [CPSL](https://wsn.cse.wustl.edu/index.php/Cyber-Physical_Systems_Laboratory) at Washington University in St. Louis, advised by [Prof. Chenyang Lu](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~lu/).

## Education

- **Ph.D. Student** – Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University (2025–Present)
- **M.S.** – Artificial Intelligence Engineering (Electrical & Computer Engineering), Carnegie Mellon University (2024)
- **B.S.** – Computer Engineering and Computer Science (dual degree), Washington University in St. Louis (2023)

## Research Interests

My research interests span several areas of artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems. In particular, I’m passionate about:

- **Scalable multi-agent systems** – large-scale cooperative systems, coordination and dynamic communication among agents
- **Embodied and generative agents** – autonomous agents (often powered by LLMs) with collective reasoning, cross-domain generalization, and secure decentralized operation
- **Human-agent teaming** – interpretability of AI decisions, human feedback integration, human–AI interaction, and trustworthiness in collaborative settings

## Teaching Experience

I really enjoy working with students. I've been a TA for a mix of undergrad and grad courses in systems and machine learning.

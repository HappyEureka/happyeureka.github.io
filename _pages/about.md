# Hanqing Yang

I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Carlee Joe-Wong](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/cjoewong/) in the [LIONS research group](https://research.ece.cmu.edu/lions/). My research focuses on the design of intelligent and cooperative multi-agent systems capable of making autonomous decisions at scale. Before coming to CMU, I had the opportunity to assist with research projects in AI for healthcare in [CPSL](https://wsn.cse.wustl.edu/index.php/Cyber-Physical_Systems_Laboratory) at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://washu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Chenyang Lu](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~lu/).

## Education

- **Ph.D. Student**: Electrical and Computer Engineering, CMU (2025–Present)
- **M.S.**: Electrical and Computer Engineering, CMU (2024)
- **B.S.**: Computer Engineering; Computer Science, WashU (2023)

## Research Interests

My research interests span artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems, with a focus on cooperative intelligence at scale. I am particularly passionate about:

- **Multi-Agent Systems**: scalability, safety, cooperative intelligence (communication, collective planning, emergent behaviors, learning, evaluation, generalization), decentralized agents, generative agents (often LLM-based), embodied agents.

## Teaching Experience

I really enjoy working with students. I've been a TA for a mix of undergrad and grad courses in systems and machine learning.
